# faint_script
Faint script for FiveM roleplay
The default fainting button is - U - you can change that to any other button you want by changing the value of "303" (which is the code of the U button) from the client.lua in the script folder. You can pick the code of the button you would like to use from here: https://docs.fivem.net/game-references/controls/ .
This is an optimised and lighter version for fainting in FiveM rp. This code requests 1 thread instead of 2. Threads are a very precious resource for server computers and should not be thrown away for bad code.
